            Hello I'm Loie, and I lead People Operations in Gitcoin.
            I'm planning a team retreat for our company &amp; our DAO to join together &amp; spend quality time, some of which includes (we hope!)
            training on how we can work better together, perhaps from someone like yourself.

          <p>
            On the second day we adjusted our plans based on the feedback we received from
            watching the team work and play on day 1. We turned towards a meme within their organization
            around ‚Äúthe coordination problem‚Äù and framed our thinking on this problem using 3 levels of a pyramid.
            Each level describes ‚Äúsetting up the work‚Äù, ‚Äúdoing the work‚Äù, and ‚Äúgrowing the work‚Äù in turn.
            We facilitated discussions around each level, pulling together the group intelligence in the
            room to apply our framing to GitCoin. From these inquiries emerged discussion subjects which
            we coordinated using an adaptation of Open Space Technology.
            Each group worked on their problem then reported back to the full group on the ‚Äúhighest-impact insight‚Äù.

          <p>This was our first in-person facilitation job as People Medicine in almost 2 years. It was the first in-person gathering many of these GitCoin members had ever had. The energy was quite powerful in the room. Furthermore, this group of people seemed to be very present and accepting of our facilitation, games, and exercises. They came with a ‚Äúyes and‚Äù attitude. They were critical and helpful, curious and wise. A thrill to work with. Only time will tell what kind of impact our sessions will have had. Though in the brief afterglow of the space we hosted here is an sampling of the feedback we received:</p>
